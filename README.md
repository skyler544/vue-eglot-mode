# Vue Eglot Mode

This (very rudimentary) major mode represents the most minimal working example I could come up with of getting the volar language server working with eglot and web-mode.

# Usage

```lisp
(use-package vue-eglot-mode
  :ensure t
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/skyler544/vue-eglot-mode")
  :mode "\\.vue$")
```

# Contributions

Yes, please.
